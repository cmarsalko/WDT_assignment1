      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p id="bio">
        Andrew McCutchen became the face of the Pittsburgh Pirates during the 2010s, bringing energy and leadership to a franchise long in need of revival. 
        From 2009–2017, he was a five-time All-Star, won the 2013 National League MVP, and helped the Pirates reach the postseason for the first time in 20 years. 
        Beloved by fans for both his play and personality, McCutchen’s return to Pittsburgh late in his career has only cemented his place as a franchise icon.
