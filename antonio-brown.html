      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p id="bio">
        Antonio Brown rose from a sixth-round draft pick in 2010 to one of the most unstoppable wide receivers of his era. 
        During his prime years with the Steelers, he earned seven Pro Bowl selections, led the league in receiving yards twice, 
        and produced some of the most memorable highlights in franchise history. 
        Despite a turbulent career later on, his production in Pittsburgh places him among the greatest receivers in team history.
